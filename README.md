Assessment   Description
SCENARIOThere has been a   major incident for the company ACME.LTD. Their main business is   a   mixture   of   manufacturing    and    distribution       management    for      other      organizations.      ACME.LTD       has    the   following network infrastructure.
   
The following services are running within the   network:
●         Windows Active   Directory
●          DHCP
●         DNS Servers
●         Mail Server (running SMTP    POP3)
●         OpenVPN
●         MsSQL   Databases
●         Multiple Samba Servers
●         Web ServersThe ACME.LTD's databases were compromised via an   internal web server.   It   was   accessible   via   a   lost   laptop. The   lost   laptop only   required a   username and   password to access   it.   However, the   password was at   least   16 characters   long, SecureBoot and full disk encryption   were   not   in   use.   All   workstations   and   laptops   in   use   are   not   part   of the   Windows   Active   Directory   domain.   This   means all accounts used are   local accounts.Additionally,   the   attackers   were   able   to   use   the   access   to   the   MsSQL   services   to   pivot   to   the   companies OT   network and deploy   ransomware. This   resulted   in the   complete shutdown   of   the   operations that   relied   upon the OT systems that   had   been Windows-based.
INSTRUCTIONSThis   individual    assessment   consists   of    THREE   tasks   as    mentioned    below.    Please    carefully   consider   completing   all   tasks   and   prepare   your   final   report.   You   are   expected   to   submit   this   report   on   Learning   Central which   requires   coursework submission   as   a single   report   of 2,000   words   (maximum,   including all except   references). There should   not   be any   appendix   attached   or included in this report. The expected font size   is   12 and   the   font   type   is   ‘Arial’   on   all   pages.   There   is   no   need to add a cover   page with   your   submission   but   write   your   student   number   and   name   on   the   top   of   the   first   page   of   the   report.   You’re   expected   to   back your   answers   with   citations.   Note, there is no ±10% word count criteria for this coursework. It is expected that your   report (excluding references) must be within   the 2,000 words count.   Anything written beyond   the   first   2,000 words would   be   ignored   during   marking.   Indicative word   count   against   each task   is   mentioned.   However,   this   is   not   a   strict   limit   for   each   task,   rather   this   should   be   used   as   a   baseline for the expected amount of text/explanation against the maximum marks assigned for   each task.
Task   1 [T1]: The CEO and CISO of ACME.TLD would   like you to   review their   network architecture   as   previously   presented   and   identify   security   issues,   potential   risks,   and   insecure   properties.
[Indicative word count: 500]Task   2   [T2]:    Provide    recommendations   with   evidence   of   the    best    practices   and   applicable   approaches to secure their   network. Also,   provide   reflect   on   (i) what   could   be   easily   prevented   and   how,   (ii)   if   not   prevented,   what   could   be   detected   and   how,   and   (iii)   if   not   prevented   and   detected,   what   could   be   recovered   from   security   incidents   and   how.   [Indicative   word   count:   1,000]Task   3   [T3]:   The   CEO   and   CISO   are   keen to   also   know   what   additional technology   and tooling   could   also   be   used   to   help   future   proof   the   system   and justify   your   choices.   [Indicative   word   count: 500]

References   are   not   counted   in   the   word   limit.   Use   the   IEEE   format   references:   https://ieee-   dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf.
This point will be further discussed in one of the   lectures of the   module.
